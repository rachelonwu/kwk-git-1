        <p class="journey">
          I began my web development journey with a Girls Who Code Summer
          Immersion Program, making a personal protfolio website (linked below),
          a personality quiz, and an activist toolkit website.

          I participated in a few hackathons and expanded on my HTML and CSS
          skills.

        <p class="journey">
          Through dual enrollment, I took a college-level web development
          course. I also took AP Computer Science A and Principles, learning
          Java. During the summer, I participated in the Kode With Klossy Mobile
          App Development Camp, using Swift and SwiftUI through XCode. I
          co-developed an app focused on limiting food waste by providing simple
          recipes with ingredients commonly found in households. Later that
          summer, I worked as a Software Development Intern at rrtQ Inc,
          learning the basics of SQL and Figma.

          I took another dual enrollment class for beginner's Python. I also ran
          my school's Computer Science Club and promoted/attended a few
          hackathons throughout the year focused on web development.

        <p class="journey">
          In my first year of college, I took a beginner and intermediate Python
          course. In the spring, I began a research internship at Massachusetts
          General Hospital, using R to analyzing user data of an app focused on
          providing mentalizing imagery therapy to caregivers of dementia
          patients. I am currently in this role, and am also working as an IT
          intern for Skyla Credit Union, using my web development skills to fix
          HTML pages and design a program to automate account number changes.
